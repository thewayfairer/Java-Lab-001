  A statement is a command or instruction that tells a computer to perform a specific action. A comment is a note or explanation added to a program's code that is ignored by the computer when the program is run.

A program is considered portable if it can run on different types of computers or operating systems without modification.

To "compile" a program means to convert the source code of a program into machine code, which can be executed by a computer.

An executable is a file that contains machine code that can be run on a computer. It is called an "executable" because it can be executed, or run, by the computer.
